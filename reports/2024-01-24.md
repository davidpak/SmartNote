## Goals from Last Week

(none)

## Progress and Issues

### Progress

- Set up Tailwind CSS and theme
- Created some basic UI components
  - Heading components
  - Sidebar component
  - Toggle component
  - Banner component for dropzone error
  - Button component
- Set up session management on server
  - JSON Web Tokens in HTTP messages
  - Session-specific resources (such as uploaded files)
  - Garbage collector for expired sessions
  - Storage quota for each session
- Support for file uploading (`upload` RPC)
- Added skeleton code for other RPCs
  - `login`
  - `generate`
  - `export`
  - `fetch`
- Added specification for RPC syntax and semantics
- Backend utilities
  - Filesystem access
  - Cryptography/Encryption
- Implemented rough draft Python script for summarizing Youtube Videos
  - Established connection to OpenAI API
  - Utilized recursive character splitting to optimize token requests to API
  - Implemented simple prompt requests to LLM

### Challenges and Roadblocks

- Session management was difficult as there were several tasks:
  - Secure storage of tokens
  - Abstract resource operations
  - Token renewal would generate a whole new JWT but need to identify a client across renewals, so we cannot use the token directly.
  - Expose as little as possible about a token to the client
  - Garbage collect resources associated with expired sessions
- Optimizing token usage from the OpenAI API to limit costs took some challenging steps

  - Implement home page. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
  - Implement pages for customizing notes. (Time Estimate: 2 days)
- [ ] Partially implemented `generate` and `export` RPC. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
- [ ] Improve resource system. (Time Estimate: 2 days)
  - Improve security and useability of resource manager. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
  - Additional abstractions for session resource access. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
- [ ] Fully implemented `fetch` RPC. (Time Estimate: 2 days)
  - Basic request management. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
  - Make behavior consistent the documented semantics. (Time Estimate: 1 day)
