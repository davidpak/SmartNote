# Team Report

## Goals from Last Week

- Implement `generate` - Fully implement `generate` RPC
  - Need to wait for David's script to accept input, but then just need to run the script from Java
- Implement `export` - Fully implement `export` RPC
  - Need to wait for David's script to output files, but then just need to read output file and process accordingly
  - Add Notion exporting support
- Implement more components including `Dropzone`, `FileList`, `CheckboxTree`, `Modal`.
- Start implementing application pages.

## Progress and Issues

### Progress

- Created more UI components
  - `Dropzone`
  - `FileListItem`
  - `Modal`
- Set up client CI
- Added basic tests for different components (client side)
- Fixed component prop interfaces
- Updated LLM model to GPT-4
- Configured LLM to accept PDFs now
- Brainstormed using Mathpix API to better parse mathenatical equations
- Added tests for properly generating vector stores and utilizing the embeddings.

### Challenges and Roadblocks

- Mathpix API requires more money to spend
- Generated LLM output is not as robust and detailed for PDFs

## Plans and Goals for Next Week

- [ ] **_Task name_** - **_Description_** (Time Estimate: **_X_** days)
  - **_Subtask A_** (Time Estimate: **_Y_** days)
  - **_Subtask B_** (Time Estimate: **_Z_** days)
- [ ] Finish implementing basic components including `Container` and `CheckboxTree`. (Time Estimate: 3 days)
- [ ] Implement the application UI/pages (core functionality). (Time Estimate: 3 days)
- [ ] Commect the LLM with the rest of the application (Time estimate 3-4 days)
