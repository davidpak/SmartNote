# Team Report

## Goals from Last Week

- Finish setting up basic components including container, nav bar, dropzone, files (upload), files (review output page), modal, slider, dropdown select.
- Partially implement application UI structure.
  - Implement home page.
  - Implement pages for customizing notes.
- Partially implemented `generate` and `export` RPC.
- Improve resource system.
  - Improve security and useability of resource manager.
  - Additional abstractions for session resource access.
- Fully implemented `fetch` RPC.
  - Basic request management.
  - Make behavior consistent the documented semantics.

## Progress and Issues

### Progress

- Implemented multiple RPCs and fixed issues with existing ones
- Set up a testing framework
- Successfully calibrated LLM to produce output in desired format
- Set up output file `output.md` for LLM to write to 

### Challenges and Roadblocks

- Getting the testing framework set up ran into issues due to Java versions and the libraries being used. One of the libraries used (Mockito) depends on a specific Java version, so we had to change from Java 8 to Java 17.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week

- [ ] Implement `generate` - Fully implement `generate` RPC (Time Estimate: 1 days)
  - Need to wait for David's script to accept input, but then just need to run the script from Java (Time Estimate: 1 days)
- [ ] Implement `export` - Fully implement `export` RPC (Time Estimate: 2 days)
  - Need to wait for David's script to output files, but then just need to read output file and process accordingly (Time Estimate: 1 days)
  - Add Notion exporting support (Time Estimate: 1 days)
- [ ] **_Task name_** - **_Description_** (Time Estimate: **_X_** days)
  - **_Subtask A_** (Time Estimate: **_Y_** days)
  - **_Subtask B_** (Time Estimate: **_Z_** days)
