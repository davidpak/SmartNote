## Explain it to a 5th grader:
Quaternions are a special kind of numbers that help us describe how things rotate in 3D. They are like a secret code that tells us how an object is turned or oriented in space. Quaternions are really useful for computer graphics, robots, and virtual reality because they don't have any bugs or problems like other methods. They make it easy to rotate things smoothly and without any mistakes.
