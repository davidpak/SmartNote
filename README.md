# SmartNote
SmartNote revolutionizes student engagement with LangChain, TypeScript, and Notion API. It automates detailed note creation from videos and PDFs, seamlessly integrating into the userâ€™s Notion workspace.

## Layout

* `client/` - Client resources
  * `src/` - Client web source code
* `server/` - Server resources
  * `main/` - Server sources
    * `src/` - Main runtime sources
    * `test/` - Test sources
  * `scripts/` - Scripts used by the server

## Building

### Client

The client uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and React. Ensure you have installed these before continuing. You may test your installation by running `node --version` and `npm --version` in a terminal.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the `client/` directory.

Dependencies are specified in `package.json`. To download them, use:

`npm install`

Then, to build the client, do:

`npm run build`

### Server

The server uses [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/index.html) as its build system and [Apache Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/) as its dependency manager. Ensure you have installed these before continuing (or you are using an IDE with built-in support). For Ivy, `ivy-x.x.x.jar` must be somewhere within Ant's library path (usually in the library directory at `~/.ant/lib/` or `ANT_HOME/lib/`). You may test your installation by running `ant -version` in a terminal. An installation of [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 1.8 or higher is required. You may test your installation by running `java -version` in a terminal.

[JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) is used as the testing framework. It should be downloaded when running `ant resolve`, but if not, download it and ensure that `junit-4.x.jar` is on the classpath. You may need to add libraries to Ant's library path. See how [Ant handles JUnit](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html) for more information.

Make sure your working directory is the `server/` directory before running any commands. The following commands are important:

* `ant resolve` - Checks for and downloads dependencies.
* `ant build` - Builds the server. This will download dependencies if they have not already been downloaded.
* `ant jar` - Creates a JAR file of the server. This will build the server if it has not already been built.
* `ant dist` - Creates a standalone distributable archive of the server. This will build the server if it has not already been built.
* `ant build-test` - Builds the server and tests.

You may also set up an IDE to build and run the server. Ensure your IDE has support for Ant and set up your project to use the buildfile `server/build.xml`, have configured it to use a suitable JRE, and to include all of the `jar` files in the `server/lib/` directory on the classpath.

## Running

First, be sure to build the client and server. See the previous section for instructions.

### Client

From within the `client/` directory, do:

`npm run dev`

### Server

Make sure your working directory is the `server/` directory before running any commands. The following commands are important:

* `ant run` - Runs the server. This will build the server if it has not already been built. Specify `--Dargs="..."` to pass arguments to the server. This will only run the compiled classes, not the JAR file or distributable archive.
* `ant test` - Runs the server tests. This will build the server and the tests if they have not already been built.

If you have built a JAR file of the server, you may run either `server.bat [args...]` (Windows) or `server.sh [args...]` (Mac/Linux) from the `server/` directory.

When using an IDE, you may need to setup run configurations to target buildfile `server/build.xml`. Some IDEs may be able to build without Ant, but you may need to set up the classpath within your IDE's configuration. It must include all of the `jar` files in the `server/lib/` directory. Ensure your IDE has set the working directory to the `server/` directory.

## Third-Party Libraries

* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
* [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) - Used for testing server.
* [Spark](https://sparkjava.com/) - Used as the backend web framework.
